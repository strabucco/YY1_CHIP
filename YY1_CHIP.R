#R script for downloading and analyzing ChIP data
#This will be used to compare ChIP binding between YY1 and EZH2 in B-cells

#load packages needed

#download data for YY1 ChIP-Seq
#load peaks
#annotate YY1 file

#download and load EZH2 file
#filter file by EZH2 peaks in CB but not ESCs, also remove those without peaks
#also filter file by EZH2 peaks in CB (all)


#compare gene names from YY1 annotation to EZH2 filtered files ($ORF)
#get number of gene names overlapping and a CSV or output list of names
