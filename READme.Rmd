This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The YY1_CHIP.R file contains R script that opens CHIP-seq data from a local file (YY1 Factor data for GM12878 cell line from: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeSydhTfbs) and processes using ChIPseeker package to load and annotate peaks. This file also cleans up the annotation to remove duplicates and any NA values in the SYMBOL feature.

The file also loads a local csv file (EZH2 ChIP-Chip obtained from Velichutina et al, Blood, 2009: http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/116/24/5247.long) with ChIP-Chip data annotated and cleans up the data. The data is then processed into those with peaks in centroblasts (CB) and not in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and those with peaks in CB regardless of peaks in ESCs. 

The ChIP-seq and ChIP-ChIP processed data are then compared to find common peaks between the two.
